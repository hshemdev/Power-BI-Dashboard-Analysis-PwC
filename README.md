Enhancing Customer Experience: A Power BI Dashboard Analysis

In today's competitive telecom industry, understanding customer needs and preferences is crucial for success. As part of a virtual internship at PwC, I was tasked with creating a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics from a call center dataset. This project aimed to provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction, call handling efficiency, and agent performance, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of overall customer experience.

Project Overview:

The primary objective of this project was to develop a dynamic and visually engaging dashboard in Power BI that encapsulates the essential KPIs and metrics relevant to our client, a prominent telecom company. By leveraging the provided call center dataset, I meticulously crafted a dashboard that offers a holistic view of critical performance indicators, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to improve customer service and operational efficiency.

Key Components of the Dashboard:

The Power BI dashboard encompasses a range of KPIs and metrics, including but not limited to:

1. Overall Customer Satisfaction: A comprehensive analysis of customer feedback and satisfaction scores, providing insights into the quality of service and customer experience.

2. Calls Answered/Abandoned: Tracking the volume of calls answered and abandoned over time, highlighting trends and potential areas for improvement in call handling.

3. Calls by Time: Visual representation of call volume across different time periods, aiding in resource allocation and scheduling optimization.

4. Average Speed of Answer: Monitoring the average time taken to answer customer calls, identifying opportunities to reduce wait times and enhance responsiveness.

5. Agent's Performance Quadrant: A quadrant analysis comparing average handle time (talk duration) versus calls answered, facilitating the evaluation of agent efficiency and productivity.
